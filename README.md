# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Unfortunately, my computer battery needed replaced and was in the shop this week. My computer also needed an update which un-installed my pgadmin4. I lost my databases I had created over the past week. I only made it through  part of Deliverable 1, so I will just take the points for that. If I have time, I will go back and redo the challenge, but I would rather catch up on Module 8 and keep on track. Apologies and thanks.
